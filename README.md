Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

Hi there! I'm Rohaizad, a front-end developer with over 4 years of experience using ReactJS. My main framework for projects is NextJS.

To get started compiling this NextJS web application, make sure your machine meets all of these requirements:

- Node.js 18.17 or later.
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

### Run the Development Server

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm run install
```
2. Run npm run dev to start the development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```
3. Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.
4. That's it!
